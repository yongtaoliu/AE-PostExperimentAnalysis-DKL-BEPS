# Forensics-DKL-BEPS
This notebook descrips the Forensics analysis of deep kernel leanring driven automated piezoresponse force microscopy experiments.

Forensic analysis here is an examination of the ative learning driven autonomous experiment's results and the learning processes. We want to gain a deeper understanding of the process of autonomous experiments and identify potentials for improvement. This will offer signals for human intervention at specific points to influence the AI-driven experiment. Human intervention could involve modifying experiment parameters, adjusting acqusitions or target properties, or addressing unforeseen issues that the autonomous experiments might encounter. The combination of autonomous experiments and human intervention has the potential of leveraging the strengths of both machine learning and human expertise via a more adaptable experimental process.

Figure. Human vs. AI assisted experiments. (a) In human controlled paradigm, human operator issues control commands in the instrument specific hyper language for certain experiments. (b) In ML driven autonomous experiments, the human operator is substituted by the AI agent. (c) In AI assisted human-in-the-loop paradigm, human operator oversees experiments run by the AI agent. During this, human can directly intervene into experiment or tune (in real time) decision making process of the ML agent, which requires developing the methodology to monitor and intervene in the ML-driven autonomous experiments.
